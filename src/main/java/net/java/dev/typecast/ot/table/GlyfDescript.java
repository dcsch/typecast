     * <p>
     * A non-zero-fill algorithm is needed to avoid dropouts when contours
     * overlap. The {@link #OVERLAP_SIMPLE} flag is used by some rasterizer
     * implementations to ensure that a non-zero-fill algorithm is used rather
     * than an even-odd-fill algorithm. Implementations that always use a
     * non-zero-fill algorithm will ignore this flag. Note that some
     * implementations might check this flag specifically in non-variable fonts,
     * but always use a non-zero-fill algorithm for variable fonts. This flag
     * can be used in order to provide broad interoperability of fonts —
     * particularly non-variable fonts — when glyphs have overlapping contours.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * Note that variable fonts often make use of overlapping contours. This has
     * implications for tools that generate static-font data for a specific
     * instance of a variable font, if broad interoperability of the derived
     * font is desired: if a glyph has overlapping contours in the given
     * instance, then the tool should either set this flag in the derived glyph
     * data, or else should merge contours to remove overlap of separate
     * contours.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * Note: The OVERLAP_COMPOUND flag, described below, has a similar purpose
     * in relation to composite glyphs. The same considerations described for
     * the OVERLAP_SIMPLE flag also apply to the OVERLAP_COMPOUND flag.
