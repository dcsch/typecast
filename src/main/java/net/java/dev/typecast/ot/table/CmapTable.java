/**
 * Character to Glyph Index Mapping Table
 * 
 * <p>
 * This table defines the mapping of character codes to the glyph index values
 * used in the font. It may contain more than one subtable, in order to support
 * more than one character encoding scheme.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Overview</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This table defines mapping of character codes to a default glyph index.
 * Different subtables may be defined that each contain mappings for different
 * character encoding schemes. The table header indicates the character
 * encodings for which subtables are present.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Regardless of the encoding scheme, character codes that do not correspond to
 * any glyph in the font should be mapped to glyph index 0. The glyph at this
 * location must be a special glyph representing a missing character, commonly
 * known as .notdef.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each subtable is in one of seven possible formats and begins with a format
 * field indicating the format used. The first four formats — formats 0, 2, 4
 * and 6 — were originally defined prior to Unicode 2.0. These formats allow for
 * 8-bit single-byte, 8-bit multi-byte, and 16-bit encodings. With the
 * introduction of supplementary planes in Unicode 2.0, the Unicode addressable
 * code space extends beyond 16 bits. To accommodate this, three additional
 * formats were added — formats 8, 10 and 12 — that allow for 32-bit encoding
 * schemes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Other enhancements in Unicode led to the addition of other subtable formats.
 * Subtable format 13 allows for an efficient mapping of many characters to a
 * single glyph; this is useful for “last-resort” fonts that provide fallback
 * rendering for all possible Unicode characters with a distinct fallback glyph
 * for different Unicode ranges. Subtable format 14 provides a unified mechanism
 * for supporting Unicode variation sequences.
 * </p>
