/**
 * Horizontal Metrics Table
 * 
 * <p>
 * Glyph metrics used for horizontal text layout include glyph advance widths,
 * side bearings and X-direction min and max values (xMin, xMax). These are
 * derived using a combination of the glyph outline data ('glyf', 'CFF ' or
 * CFF2) and the horizontal metrics table. The horizontal metrics ('hmtx') table
 * provides glyph advance widths and left side bearings.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In a font with TrueType outline data, the 'glyf' table provides xMin and xMax
 * values, but not advance widths or side bearings. The advance width is always
 * obtained from the 'hmtx' table. In some fonts, depending on the state of
 * flags in the 'head' table, the left side bearings may be the same as the xMin
 * values in the 'glyf' table, though this is not true for all fonts. (See the
 * description of bit 1 of the {@link HeadTable#getFlags() flags} field in the
 * 'head' table.) For this reason, left side bearings are provided in the 'hmtx'
 * table. The right side bearing is always derived using advance width and left
 * side bearing values from the 'hmtx' table, plus bounding-box information in
 * the glyph description — see below for more details.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In a variable font with TrueType outline data, the left side bearing value in
 * the 'hmtx' table must always be equal to xMin (bit 1 of the 'head'
 * {@link HeadTable#getFlags() flags} field must be set). Hence, these values
 * can also be derived directly from the 'glyf' table. Note that these values
 * apply only to the default instance of the variable font: non-default
 * instances may have different side bearing values. These can be derived from
 * interpolated “phantom point” coordinates using the 'gvar' table (see below
 * for additional details), or by applying variation data in the HVAR table to
 * default-instance values from the 'glyf' or 'hmtx' table.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In a font with CFF version 1 outline data, the 'CFF ' table does include
 * advance widths. These values are used by PostScript processors, but are not
 * used in OpenType layout. In an OpenType context, the 'hmtx' table is required
 * and must be used for advance widths. Note that fonts in a Font Collection
 * file that share a 'CFF ' table may specify different advance widths in
 * font-specific 'hmtx' tables for a particular glyph index. Also note that the
 * CFF2 table does not include advance widths. In addition, for either CFF or
 * CFF2 data, there are no explicit xMin and xMax values; side bearings are
 * implicitly contained within the CharString data, and can be obtained from the
 * the CFF / CFF2 rasterizer. Some layout engines may use left side bearing
 * values in the 'hmtx' table, however; hence, font production tools should
 * ensure that the lsb values in the 'hmtx' table match the implicit xMin values
 * reflected in the CharString data. In a variable font with CFF2 outline data,
 * left side bearing and advance width values for non-default instances should
 * be obtained by combining information from the 'hmtx' and HVAR tables.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The table uses a longHorMetric record to give the advance width and left side
 * bearing of a glyph. Records are indexed by glyph ID. As an optimization, the
 * number of records can be less than the number of glyphs, in which case the
 * advance width value of the last record applies to all remaining glyph IDs.
 * This can be useful in monospaced fonts, or in fonts that have a large number
 * of glyphs with the same advance width (provided the glyphs are ordered
 * appropriately). The number of longHorMetric records is determined by the
 * numberOfHMetrics field in the 'hhea' table.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the longHorMetric array is less than the total number of glyphs, then that
 * array is followed by an array for the left side bearing values of the
 * remaining glyphs. The number of elements in the left side bearing will be
 * derived from numberOfHMetrics plus the numGlyphs field in the 'maxp' table.
 * </p>
