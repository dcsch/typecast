     * Bit 3: Force ppem to integer values for all internal scaler math; may use
     * fractional ppem sizes if this bit is clear;
     * 
     * Bit 4: Instructions may alter advance width (the advance widths might not
     * scale linearly);
     * 
     * Bit 5: This bit is not used in OpenType, and should not be set in order
     * to ensure compatible behavior on all platforms. If set, it may result in
     * different behavior for vertical layout in some platforms. (See Apple’s
     * specification for details regarding behavior in Apple platforms.)
     * 
     * Bits 6–10: These bits are not used in Opentype and should always be
     * cleared. (See Apple’s specification for details regarding legacy used in
     * Apple platforms.)
     * 
     * Bit 11: Font data is “lossless” as a result of having been subjected to
     * optimizing transformation and/or compression (such as e.g. compression
     * mechanisms defined by ISO/IEC 14496-18, MicroType Express, WOFF 2.0 or
     * similar) where the original font functionality and features are retained
     * but the binary compatibility between input and output font files is not
     * guaranteed. As a result of the applied transform, the DSIG table may also
     * be invalidated.
     * 
     * Bit 12: Font converted (produce compatible metrics)
     * 
     * Bit 13: Font optimized for ClearType™. Note, fonts that rely on embedded
     * bitmaps (EBDT) for rendering should not be considered optimized for
     * ClearType, and therefore should keep this bit cleared.
     * 
     * Bit 14: Last Resort font. If set, indicates that the glyphs encoded in
     * the 'cmap' subtables are simply generic symbolic representations of code
     * point ranges and don’t truly represent support for those code points. If
     * unset, indicates that the glyphs encoded in the 'cmap' subtables
     * represent proper support for those code points.
     * 
     * Bit 15: Reserved, set to 0
     * 
     * Note that, in a variable font with TrueType outlines, the left side
     * bearing for each glyph must equal {@link #_xMin}, and bit 1 in the flags
     * field must be set. 
     *
