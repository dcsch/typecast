{"name":"Typecast","tagline":"OpenType Font Design System for Java","body":"# Typecast\r\n\r\n[Retired java.net home](https://java.net/projects/typecast)\r\n\r\nTypecast is a font development environment for OpenType font technology.\r\nDevelopments include:\r\n\r\n* An outline editor for both TrueType and PostScript outlines\r\n* TrueType hinting engine\r\n* PostScript hinting engine\r\n* Hinting debuggers\r\n* Font conversion utilities\r\n* Font handling libraries for use in wider application development\r\n\r\nParts of the Typecast libraries are used in the Apache Batik project, for\r\nconversion from TrueType to SVG fonts. Further contributions will be made to\r\nBatik - particularly in the areas of PostScript outlines and font hinting.\r\n\r\n## File Formats (Native)\r\n\r\nOpenType fonts come in a small range of file format flavours. Typecast supports\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n* ttf - The basic TrueType font file\r\n* otf - Essentially the same as ttf, but usually contain a PostScript\r\n  outline rather than a TrueType outline\r\n* ttc - TrueType Collection file. This is a collection of fonts that share\r\n  some common tables. Often utilised by far eastern fonts to make more\r\n  efficient use of shared components\r\n* dfont - A Macintosh Font Suitcase resource file, with the resources in\r\n  the data fork - as utilised by MacOS X\r\n\r\n## File Formats (Export)\r\n\r\n* svg - Scalable Vector Graphics font data\r\n\r\n## File Formats (Import)\r\n\r\nNo import file formats are supported as yet, but traditional PostScript Type 1\r\nand Compact Font Format (CFF) font import are under development.\r\n\r\n## Outlines\r\n\r\nCurrent outline support is for TrueType outlines. But of course, PostScript\r\noutlines are on the development roadmap.\r\n\r\n## Advanced Typographic Tables\r\n\r\nPartial support is in place for the Advanced Typographic Tables, specifically\r\nthe GPOS and GSUB tables. All advanced tables will be implemented in the\r\nongoing development.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
